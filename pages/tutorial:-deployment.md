# Deploying your Evidence Project

_(To deploy your project, you currently need Evidence [installed locally](/))_

You can deploy your Evidence project to a public URL or to a password-protected domain. Configure in the [settings menu](/settings).

More info is available in our [deployment docs]()

## Evidence Cloud
If you are interested in using Evidence, but you would prefer not to self-host your project, you might be interested in our forthcoming cloud service.

To be notified when Evidence Cloud is available, sign up for the [waitlist](https://du3tapwtcbi.typeform.com/to/kwp7ZD3q).
